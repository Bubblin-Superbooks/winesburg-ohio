the house, and so he went into a harness shop on a side

things," he said to the grandmother, who didn't know
what the boy was talking about but loved him so much
that it didn't matter whether she understood or not.</p><p class=" stretch-last-line ">For a year Tom Foster lived in the banker's stable</p></div> </div>
