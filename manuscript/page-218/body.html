called the best telegraph operator in the state, and in
spite of his degradement to the obscure office at
Winesburg, he was still proud of his ability.</p><p>Wash Williams did not associate with the men of the
town in which he lived. "I'll have nothing to do with

them. "Does not every man let his life be managed for
him by some bitch or another?" he asked.</p></div> </div>
